Hardware Setup
----

After some fussing we found Trammell Hudson's really excellent [Octoscroller](http://trmm.net/Octoscroller) and LEDscape project to interface with our low-level hardware.

### Adafruit

Buy a [BeagleBone Black](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1876), some [LED Panels](https://www.adafruit.com/product/420) and a nice [5V power supply](https://www.adafruit.com/products/658). 

### OSH Park

We also need an [Octoscroller cape](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/7mSHNZcD). You can order the cape circuit board in sets of 3 from OSH Park! Share with a friend! The process takes two or three weeks.

### Digikey

Make a [DigiKey](http://www.digikey.com) order. Here are the parts you want:

| Quantity   | Part Number  | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1  | 296-8503-5-ND  | 8-bit bus transceiver |
|  8 | S9171-ND  | 16 pin ribbon connector |
|  4 | S1012E-36-ND | Breakable header pins | 

### Soldering


Solder your hardware. The buffer IC goes on the underside of the circuit board. The hole in the ribbon cable connectors face towards the bottom of the PCB.

These LED panels use a lot of power. Make sure you have an adequate power supply or you may experience funny issues!
